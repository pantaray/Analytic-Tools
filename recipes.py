def query_yes_no(question, default=None):
    """
    Ask a yes/no question via raw_input() and return their answer.

    "question" is a string that is presented to the user.
    "default" is the presumed answer if the user just hits <Enter>.
        It must be "yes" (the default), "no" or None (meaning
        an answer is required of the user).

    The "answer" return value is one of "yes" or "no".

def natural_sort(l): 
    """
    Sort a Python list l in a "natural" way

    From the documentation of sort_nat.m:

    "Natural order sorting sorts strings containing digits in a way such that
    the numerical value of the digits is taken into account.  It is
    especially useful for sorting file names containing index numbers with
    different numbers of digits.  Often, people will use leading zeros to get
    the right sort order, but with this function you don't have to do that."

    For instance, a usual glob will give you a file listing sorted in this way 

        ['Elm11', 'Elm12', 'Elm2', 'elm0', 'elm1', 'elm10', 'elm13', 'elm9']

    Calling natural_sort on that list results in 

        ['elm0', 'elm1', 'Elm2', 'elm9', 'elm10', 'Elm11', 'Elm12', 'elm13']
