Tools for Computational Neuroscience in Python
==============================================
This Python package comprises open source software tools for computational neuroscience 
developed in the
`Dystonia and Motor Control Laboratory <https://www.masseyeandear.org/research/otolaryngology/investigators/laboratories/simonyanlab>`_ directed by
`Kristina Simonyan, MD., PhD., Dr. med. <https://www.masseyeandear.org/research/investigators/s/simonyan-kristina>`_ at
`Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary <https://www.masseyeandear.org/>`_,
`Harvard Medical School <https://hms.harvard.edu/>`_, Boston MA. 

We are offering them as a free resource for the neuroscience community.

The implemented routines provide functionality to

* construct functional networks using different statistical dependence measures
* calculate graph metrics
* perform various forms of absolute and relative network thresholding
* construct random graphs
* visualize networks in 2D or 3D
* render the spatial embedding of networks in three-dimensional brain surfaces
* simulate brain activity using a biological neural population model
